---------------------------------------------------IPA Changes--------

Few changes / development are suggested below.

 

1.  Change in Routing

 

Kindly update the  New Mapping w.e.f. 01-09-2018 . FC at RO Level

RO Level FC only to be added where RM is approving authority (i.e if NRM is above Rs 2000).

Other Mapping need not to be change. i.e RO level FC not to be included if NRM is Less than Rs 2000 , i.e where Approving authority is Zonal Head , CGM-Sales & ED-LPG.

 

2.  Discount uploads from IPA Portal

 

After approving of discount in IPA portal , Discount upload menu to be provided to SO/Regional Manager to directly push the discount in JDE with flexibility to reduce the discount amount than the approved amount, but not above the approved amount

It should have validation checks so that double or multiple discount are not entered. It should have some flag if discount is already uploaded in JDE

 

3.  Additional Development

1.    System should show Last Month Sales in MT & Discount in Rs /MT (both from JDE) in approval/ recommendation menu so that user can view while approving or recommending the proposal.

2.    One Menu is required with from date-to date & drop –down ( All India/ Zones/ Regional Offices/Sales Area) , where customer wise –month wise Committed Sales, Actual Sales , Discount approved & discount uploaded should be generated and facility to export in excel.

 

4.  IPA menu to be provided to in Business link (just above the LPG Application)
